# Memory Game

This memory game is a design challenge for the Digital Innovation One platform.

I chose as the theme of this game, the Netflix series Stranger Things, each pair of cards, are famous characters that conquered the public, and that recently, with the new season launched, gained even more prominence.


## ReferÃªncia

 - [Digital Innovation One](https://www.dio.me/)
 

## Appendix

The game is very simple, you must choose a card, and a character will be displayed, then you must choose another card, if the character is different from the first one chosen, the two cards will be turned over again, if they are the same, the characters will continue overturned.


When the game is finished, with all the characters turned, you can play again by clicking on the "Start New Game" button.
